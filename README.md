# Train My Model
![GitHub license](https://img.shields.io/github/license/EASS-HIT-PART-A-2022-CLASS-III/TrainMyModel)
TrainMyModel is a web app to train a CNN (Convolution Neural Network) deep learning model to clasify between different classes.  
The user defines classes, and add the images to the dataset.  
Using Resnet-v2 as a base model, the model is refined on the user's classes and after the training, can classify new unseen samples!

The app is built using Streamlit and FastAPI in Docker.  

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/EASS-HIT-PART-A-2022-CLASS-III/TrainMyModel.git
```
2. Make sure Docker is running.
```bash
docker --version
```
3. Run from the directory 
```bash
cd TrainMyModel
docker-compose up
```
4. Go to [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000), and have fun üòä.

## Usage
1. Navigate to the Homepage on [localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
2. Define your classes and upload images for each class.
3. Choose training parameters and train the model.
4. Once the training is done, you can upload new images and classify them using the model or download the model for later use.

### Requirements
- Docker
- Python 3.9+
